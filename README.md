# car-templates-host
The car template host application allows to run POI apps built using the [Car App Library](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/apps) on Android Automotive OS devices.
This repository is a fork of the [AOSP template host](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Car/Templates/), with the stub map renderer replaced with a working map implementation using [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/).
