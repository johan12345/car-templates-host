  <!-- Boolean definitions that can be overridden by the OEMs.

     !!! IMPORTANT !!!
     Do not refer to these booleans directly from views. Booleans must be
     referred to through theme attributes (in attrs.xml).

     Any new resource added to this file should also be added to the
     overlayable.xml before OEMs can customize them.

     !!! IMPORTANT !!!
     These resources must be added to the overlayable.xml file. DO NOT
     add documentation here. Concentrate all documentation in public-ready
     comments in the overlayable.xml file. -->
